**How to change announcement banners:**

To change the content of the enrollment announcement banners on the front and Apply pages, follow these steps:

1. In dashboard, click the Announcements category in the left-hand menu. You can then add new announcements, or edit existing ones by modifying the text within the Subtitle field of the announcement page. 
2. To change which announcement is being used, simply add an "active" tag to the post you want to be active, and remove it from the previously active post.

**How to add new mentors, instructors/staff, and alumni:**

Mentors, staff/instructors, and alumni are added through the People category in the left-hand menu in dashboard.

1. To add a new person, click Add New Person, and then tag that person with either the "mentor" or "instructor/staff" tag. 
2. Similarly, a new alumni uses the "alumni" tag.
3. To change which mentors/instructors/staff are featured on the front page, simply add or remove the Featured category from those mentors you wish to change. Not that there should always be at least 3 mentors with the featured category. If there are more than 3, only 3 will be shown.

**How to add a new partner company:**

Alumni are added through the Partners category in the left-hand menu in dashboard.

1. Adding a partner company is similar to adding a new person. Just click add new person and fill in the required fields. 
2. Partner logos should be 180px x 90px, preferably on a white background.

**How to add a new featured student**

Unlike the previous examples, Featured Student content is added through the Posts category in the left-hand menu in dashboard.

1. To add a new student, click Add New Post, fill in the information, and select the Student category.
2. To change which student is featured on the front page, add or remove the "active" tag from the desired students. 

**How to change which posts are shown on the front page:**

The posts shown on the front page are the three most recent posts in the Featured category.
