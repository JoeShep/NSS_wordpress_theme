      <h2 class="bodyTitle">Fixing Nashville's Tech Talent Shortage</h2>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        All of us who have been working in and around the Nashville tech community, or who have been trying to hire or partner with skilled software developers, have known for years that Nashville has a painful shortage of these critical resources.  We've all seen the quarterly surveys from the Nashville Technology Council that show a consistent 800 to 1100 open tech jobs in Nashville.  We've all shared the frustration of spending months trying to fill software developer positions.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        In 2012 a group of Nashville technologists got together to try to find a way to address this problem.  We believed that Nashville had plenty of people with the latent talent to become tech professionals.  We knew that it didn't take a four year computer science degree to become a productive professional software developer because many of us didn't have such a degree.  We believed that we could partner with Nashville area technology employers to create a curriculum that would create the skills they needed in an entry-level software developer.

        Nashville Software School (NSS) is a career accelerator for highly motivated adult learners who possess the aptitude to become software developers.  We offer a six month, full-time vocational training program that creates career-ready entry-level software developers.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        We are a strongly community-centered organization.  Our founders, instructors and mentors are all working technology professionals in the Nashville area who have donated time, dollars and energy to help prove that the NSS model works.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>We are also a Tennessee non-profit corporation.  Our mission is to open doors to technology careers to qualified applicants irrespective of their financial resources and to grow the local tech workforce for the benefit of all local startups or established organizations.</p>
      <h2 class="bodyTitle">So does this really work?</h2>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        <img class='bodyImage left' src='<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/coding_trio.jpg' alt='3 Cohort 1 students at work' width='400px;'/>
        We have graduated 40 junior software developers since starting our first class in June 2012.  In late 2012 we graduated our first cohort of 14 developers and at mid-year 2013 we graduated an additional 26.  Most of the graduates of our first cohort are employed in software developer or other technology jobs around Nashville.  Several in our second cohort have already secured full-time positions and the remainder are actively searching for positions in Nashville.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        Our alumni work at local companies including Centresource, OnLife Health, Checkd.in, Change Healthcare, ioStudio, Zeumo, Eliza Brock Software, LiveSchool, and BorderJump.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        We have also proven to our satisfaction that there is no shortage of demand in Nashville for training from people seeking careers in software development.  And there is no shortage of people with the latent potential to become professional developers seeking a way to activate that potential.  We stopped taking applications for our third cohort of students at 200 applications - of whom at least 50 were fully qualified for admission to NSS.
      </p>
      <h2 class="bodyTitle">
        Now we Need to Make NSS Sustainable
      </h2>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        As noted above, NSS is open to qualified applicants irrespective of their ability to pay for six months of full-time training. In practical terms this means that we only ask our students for a nominal commitment fee at the beginning of the program - currently $1000. Our cost to train a student is significantly greater than $1000. But rather than require significant tuition payments up-front, payments that would have created significant barriers to a tech career for many of the great students that have graduated from our program, we recoup our investment in our students at the end of our program when they go to work as professional developers or in other technology jobs.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        <img class='bodyImage right' src='<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/images/BenWhiteBoard.jpg' alt='An instructor instructing at Nashville Software School' width='400px;'/>
        This approach aligns our incentives with those of our students. We are incented to only admit those who we truly believe have the motivation and aptitude to succeed as professional developers. We are incented to ensure that they are learning both the foundational knowledge required of all professional developers but that they are also learning tools and technologies that are widely used. We are also incented to ensure our students become deeply connected with the Nashville tech community where they aspire to work.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        We then recoup our investment once our students graduate and go to work. Our partner companies that hire graduates pay us a placement fee to offset our investment in the student and that relieves the student of his obligation to the school. Or, for those students who don't go to work for partner companies, the students repay us from their earnings as a working tech professional.  Either way, our investment in a student returns to us after they find a job. We can then re-invest in another student in a future cohort.  Over the long-term, our business model is self-sustaining.

        Support NSS & Invest in Nashville’s Tech Future
      </h2>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        The implication of the above is that to make NSS self-sustaining we need a significant working capital endowment in order to bridge the gap between our investment in a cohort of students and our collection of the resulting placement fees or student repayments.  We have been able to successfully bootstrap NSS for its first year of operation. However, to reach long-term sustainability, we now need the support of theNashville community to help us build the endowment - our working capital reserve - that we need to fully fund the school.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        You can support NSS by donating to either or both of our fund-raising campaigns.  The Cohort Three Campaign is designed to build our working capital reserve and help us afford to train our third cohort of students.  Cohort 3 starts training on September 9, 2013 and will complete the first half of our Bootcamp program at the end of November.  Our goal is to raise at least $50,000 towards to costs of instructors, facilities and stipends in support of Cohort 3 by  November 30.
      </p>
      <p class='bodyText'>
        The NSS Capital Campaign will launch in September.  The goal of this campaign is to help us raise the capital required to equip our own facility with the furniture and fixtures that we need to better meet Nashville’s ongoing tech workforce development needs.  It will allow us to equip two full classrooms for both day-time and night-time classes.  It will provide adequate space to allow our mentors room to work alongside our students on class projects as well as allow students to work on apprenticeship projects after their graduation from the Bootcamp.
