		</div>
		<h4 class="homesub">Software Development Foundations</h4>
		<p>This course focuses on core technologies used to develop the back-end, or server-side, of modern web and mobile applications.  You'll learn to concepts such as object-oriented programming, test-driven development, agile methods, pair programming and source code version control.  You will apply one of the most popular, modern web application development frameworks while designing, building and delivering web application. The combination of this course and Web Development Foundations gives the student exposure to "full stack" development of web applications - from controlling the styling of the browser front-end of the application through dynamic front-end logic connected to the business logic and database on the back-end or server side of the application.</p>

		<h3 class='third homesub'>Get Paid While You Learn!</h3>
		<p class='twoThird'>Once you are accepted as an apprentice at Nashville Software School you will be paid a modest weekly stipend while you attend the Software Development Fundamentals course and work on apprenticeship projects with our partner companies.  How do you get accepted as an apprentice?  Two ways: one is to successfully complete the Web Development Fundamentals course and the other is to pass our technical interviews and be accepted directly into the Software Development Fundamentals class.</p>

<div style='clear: both;'></div>
	<h3 class='third homesub'>How much is this going to cost?</h3>
	<div class='twoThird'>
		<div class="marginPtag">
	<p>For those students who do not have the training and/or experience to be admitted directly as an apprentice, there is a tuition fee for the Web Developer Bootcamp program.  The tuition is $1000.  That's a bargain for hundreds of hours of instruction, mentoring, and guided project work.</p>
	<p>It's also a bargain given that graduates of the Web Development Foundations course qualify as an NSS apprentice, start earning a stipend and gain admission to Software Development Foundations.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top: 40px;">Seriously â€“ it really is a lot of value for $1000 to say nothing of the fact thatâ€™s it is an investment that can pay for itself many times over.</p>
	<p>If you have sufficient technical experience to be admitted directly as an apprentice, there is no tuition.  In fact, weâ€™ll pay you a stipend during the 12 weeks of the Software Development Foundations class.  The stipend will continue after the Software Development Foundations class if you are engaged by one of our partner companies as an apprentice developer.</p>
	<p>The exact amount of the stipend for the 2013 program has not been finalized.  But in terms of order of magnitude, weâ€™re talking stipends at approximately the level of barista wages.  But then, weâ€™re trying to let you stop being a barista and move into a profession with a future.</p>
	<p>The bottom line is â€“ weâ€™ll pay you to learn to become an outstanding software developer.  We only get paid back when you learn enough to start doing your internship projects for customers and when you get hired into a full-time position.</p>
	<p>We have arranged for a limited number of scholarships for students from Nashvilleâ€™s minority and disadvantaged community.  Those sponsorships will cover tuition.  We may also to arrange for appropriate computing equipment for students.  If you are interested in being considered for sponsorship, please indicate that fact on your application</p>
